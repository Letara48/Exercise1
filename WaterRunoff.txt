Pseudocode
Get roof length and width in inches
Multiply roof length by 12
Multiply roof width by 12
Multiply roof dimensionsby rainfall height in cubic inches
Divide it by 231 to get runoff in gallons


Algorithm

Declare Integar Roof Length
Declare Integar Roof Width
Declare R_l
Declare R_w
Declare Integar rain
Declare Integar runoff

Prompt user for Roof Length and Roof Width dimensions in feet 
Prompt user for rain inches

Calculate R_l = Roof Length X 12
Calculate R_w = Roof Width X 12

Get R_l and R_w

Multiply R_l X R_w = lw
Divide lw by 231 = runoff

Display runoff
